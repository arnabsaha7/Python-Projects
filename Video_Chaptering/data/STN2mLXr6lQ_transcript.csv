0.04,I'm going to be using rev.com all day
1.959,long just typing up captions banging
3.8,away on my keyboard mindlessly just
5.92,listening to audio and typing up what
7.72,I'm hearing and I'm going to see if you
9.08,can make more money doing that than you
10.759,could if you had to go out to like a
12.28,physical minimum wage 9 to-5 job could
14.679,you make more money just sat at home
16.48,working on your laptop typing away
18.24,whenever you feel like it people make
19.84,videos and it might be for YouTube or
21.84,for any other platform and they want
23.68,captions written for them YouTube autog
25.68,generates captions but sometimes they're
27.24,not quite right so if you want perfect
28.84,captions written by a real person you
30.56,can send your video to rev.com and pay
32.84,per minute to have someone write up the
34.52,captions manually they say that for each
36.48,minute of audio that you write the
37.96,captions for you can make up to $110 if
40.64,you are working a minimum wage job in
42.52,the UK at the moment and you're age 23
44.68,or older you'd be making Â£950 per hour
47.28,today I'm going to put in a standard 8
49.079,hour shift 9 to 5 to see if you can make
51.6,more money writing captions from your
53.12,laptop at home than you can in any
54.8,minimum wage job it's just about to turn
57.0,9:00 a.m. so let's head over to the
58.879,computer about 2 month ago I signed up
60.719,for rev.com I had to do this like half
62.68,an hour long sign up test where they
64.119,gave me some sample audio and I typed up
66.0,the captions then they decided if I was
67.88,like a good enough human being with
70.119,English skills they accepted me but they
72.28,said there's going to be a super long
73.56,waiting list so I've only just been
75.479,accepted 2 months after that sign up
77.4,thing once they gave me my account I
79.0,went through the onboarding process
80.479,where you have to read this super long
82.28,ridiculously long style guide showing
84.0,you how to write captions exactly how
85.96,they want you to write them I've just
87.2,spent the last 20 minutes fully like
89.079,comprehensively reading reading the
90.36,style guide and it's 18 Pages like 18 A4
94.759,pages of info it took me 20 minutes to
96.56,go through and properly digest it after
98.24,I'd got the hang of how rev.com wanted
100.04,me to write captions I had to prove that
101.84,I hadn't just skipped through the style
103.24,guide I wrote the captions for two
104.96,specific videos the first job was a bit
107.119,of a
108.56,grind oh I'm trying out the side hustle
112.32,because I'm trying to get out of debt
113.6,and then become a millionaire as fast as
115.68,possible so make sure to subscribe to
117.36,help me get that little bit closer to
118.84,that goal I've just completed the first
120.799,job it took 30 solid minutes of focus
123.64,work I got paid but I did not get paid a
126.28,lot only 998 cents 28 minutes to earn
129.879,just under $1 so far the minimum wage
133.04,job is winning I'm actually going to
134.48,start a timer the second of the two
136.16,training jobs I had to do was for 48
138.48,cents the first one took half an hour so
140.64,I was hoping that I could do this one
142.56,quite a bit faster just been smashing it
145.0,out as fast as I can and it's been 10
148.28,minutes 45 seconds so far so I've
150.72,written out all the captions and then I
152.2,still have to sync them up with the
153.519,videos I'm not done
155.08,yet 20 minutes to get 50 cents these two
158.16,training jobs ended up taking me a total
160.08,of 50 minutes and that was on top of
162.04,spending half an hour already reading
163.48,through that style guide so I was now
165.239,really eating into my 9 to-5 shift I
167.4,can't say for sure just yet but it's
169.36,kind of seeming like rev.com is a bit
172.319,like super cheap labor they just wanting
174.64,people to work for super low wages now
178.2,that I was done with all the training I
179.56,could choose which videos I wanted to
181.08,write the captions for and basically I
183.0,just wanted to start out with a video
184.599,that was just a minute or two long so
186.239,that I could be sure that I could finish
187.56,it before the deadline cuz if I didn't
189.239,I'd get a big black mark on my rev.com
191.08,account and I might get kicked off the
193.0,platform which would just be a disaster
194.959,and we'd never find out how much money
196.4,we could make in a 9 to5 shift at that
198.44,time the shortest Video available for me
200.2,to claim was 4 and 1/2 minutes long and
202.44,the deadline for that was in less than 2
204.12,hours and I just wasn't confident yet
206.0,that I would be able to write all those
207.319,captions within 2 hours so I refreshed
209.2,the page and thank God a shorter video
211.599,showed up at 1 and 1/2 minutes long so I
213.64,snapped that right up and I got to work
215.519,just had to unclaim a job that I started
217.48,because it was someone singing and it
218.92,was their own song lyrics and it was not
221.239,very clear what they were saying but I
222.48,just cracked on and started on another
224.12,job we got to make that cheddar oh man
226.76,there was three people talking at the
228.84,same time it was really hard to caption
231.0,yeah no not not worth the 50 cents or
234.439,whatever per minute I'm going to try and
235.68,find one where there's just one person
237.04,speaking here we go it's just a guy
239.84,talking to the camera just him nothing
242.36,else going on made 5 58 cents from that
248.12,I'm on the sixth minute of a 7 minute
250.76,video typing up the captions and it's
252.799,just mind numbing mind numbingly boring
256.199,and my eyes hurt cuz i' been you have to
258.799,really focus and stare at the screen
260.44,it's like continuous focused sharp
263.56,attention takes so long I mean even if
265.919,it paid minimum wage which it isn't
268.72,doing it would have be worth it just
271.16,finished a job that was doing captions
273.039,for a 7 minute video and that was a slog
275.72,took an hour
277.199,20 for $385 how is anyone doing this
281.08,like in what I guess in some countries
284.039,$3 an hour would be feasible just
286.52,finished the last job of the day it is
289.16,now well pretty much 5:00 p.m. managed
292.36,to do five jobs cuz it just take so darn
295.56,long made
298.199,$85 they plenty of side hustles where
300.96,you can make $20 in 1 hour I did a
303.52,busking video not too long ago link down
305.479,in the description and at one point I
307.0,was making about $25 an hour you could
308.919,do that for 1 hour or you can type
311.6,captions for 10
316.199,hours
